    <div id="content">
        <h1>Ma'had</h1>
        <img src="./cert.jpg" alt="Ma'had certificate">
        <p>Inspired by my two secular certificates, i decided i would complete my last Ma'had certificate! so as to balance both sides.</p>
        <h1>Catering</h1>
        <img src="./table.jpg" alt="Catering setup">
        <p>Joined a short catering course and realised that when inviting people over food is more than just the food but the set up matters as well!</p>
        <h1>Outings</h1>
        <img src="./pizza.jpg" alt="Robbertos pizza">
        <p>After a long time of being cooped up at home or studies, i would decided to go out with friends and family more often to explore new places and cuisines.
            One has to try new things to grow! plus If you ever visit Mombasa Try Robbertos pizza, it's amazing!
        and best so far in my list</p>
        <h1>Online Classes</h1>

        <p>
        Through online classes, I’ve gained a strong foundation in modern technology, especially AI. I use different AI tools not 
        only to build and debug my projects, but also for revision—platforms like Gimzo help me understand concepts faster and more 
        clearly. AI has really made my work easier and boosted my productivity… to the point where it sometimes makes me a little 
        too lazy to type my own code 😂.
